# heckbot
A goofy Discord bot for a server my friends and I use

Currently supports an !associate <keyword> <emoji> command which will cause the bot to react to any message containing keyword. Also has !dissociate <keyword> and !dissociate <keyword> <emoji> to undo this. Not super efficient, will look into improving speed next.
